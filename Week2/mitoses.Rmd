# Breast Cancer Data

- The data used for this presentation was synthetic data 
- This data included 11 variables (10 numeric, 1 categorical)
- There was a total of 600 observations
- The variables used for this analysis were: 
  - Mitoses (cell growth) as the independent variable
  - Thickness of clump (thickness of the layers of the cells) as the dependent variable
- **This assessment had the aim of understanding if there is a relationship between mitoses (number of cell divisions) and thickness of cell clumps**

- As the number of cell divisions increases, there are less cells that have a small amount of layers.

# Regression Output

- The p value for mitoses was highly significant at <0.0001. 
  - This indicates that cell division is related to cell thickness. The greater the cell division, the thicker the cells. 
  - Regression equation: $y=4.27157+X_{mitoses}0.54383$ (For each increase of cell mitoses, cell thickness is multiplied by 0.54)

# Conclusions

<div align="center">
<table border = 0 width="100%">
<tr>
<td> 
- For the synthetic breast cancer data, a simple linear regression was performed. 
- The independent variable, mitoses, was evaluated to see if increase/decrease of cell division impacted cell thickness (dependent variable)
- It was found that there was a strong relationship between mitoses and thickness, with a p value of <0.0001
  - Furthermore, it was found that with increased cell division, cells were thicker
  - Increased cell division and increased layers of cells are both related to a higher tendency for cells to not be benign 
- The final regression equation was:  $y=4.27157+X_{mitoses}0.54383$
